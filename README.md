## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.26.0 or above)
- [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) (local backend server)
- Git

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-clone.git
    cd spotify-clone
    ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies**:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Set up PocketBase**:

    - Download and install [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/).
    
    - Start the PocketBase server on your local machine:

      ```bash
      ./pocketbase serve
      ```

    - **Import the PocketBase schema**:
    
      In the PocketBase admin dashboard (accessible via `http://localhost:8090/_/`), import the schema from the `spotiffy_clone_schema.json` file included in this repository:
    
      1. Go to **Settings** > **Import Collections**.
      2. Upload the `spotiffy_clone_schema.json` file.

4. **Add sample songs to PocketBase**:

    - After importing the schema, go to the **Songs** collection in the admin dashboard.
    - Add a few random songs with the necessary fields (title, artist, album, etc.).

### Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file**:

    In the root of the project, create a `.env` file if it doesn't already exist.

2. **Add the following variables to the `.env` file**:

    ```env
    LOCAL_HOST=your_local_host_without_quotes
    SONG_COLLECTION_ID=your_song_collection_id_without_quotes
    ```

    - Replace `your_local_host_without_quotes` with your PocketBase server's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8090`).
    - Replace `your_song_collection_id_without_quotes` with the **collection ID** of the "Songs" collection in your PocketBase admin dashboard.

3. **Ensure `.env` is excluded from version control**:

    The `.env` file should already be ignored by `.gitignore`, but double-check to ensure sensitive information is not committed.

4. **Load the `.env` file in the app**:

    The app is pre-configured to use the `flutter_dotenv` package. The variables from the `.env` file will be automatically loaded when the app starts.

---

## üöÄ Running the App

1. **Run the Flutter app on your device**:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    Ensure your PocketBase server is running and accessible at the URL specified in the `.env` file.
